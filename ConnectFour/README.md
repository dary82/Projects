A classic game of Connect Four I developed during my first year of university, developed using Python.

It is played against the computer, and has 3 available levels of difficulty:

	1 - Very easy
	2 - Easy
	3 - Intermediate

It is a console-based game, where each round the player inputs the column on which he wants to make his turn(available columns are:0-6).

The game ends when either the player or the computer wins.
