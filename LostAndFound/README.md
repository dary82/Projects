Application developed at IT Brainiacs 2017-2018, a program that gives highschoolers an insight to the IT industry.

There were 4 people working on this project, me, a friend and 2 mentors.

The application is called "Lost and Found" and as the name suggests, its purpose is to help people find their lost objects around the city.

This is a WPF Application, developed using Visual Studio and for the database Microsoft SQL Server was used.
