A task management application for workers, developed using C++

You start by specifying the file location of the list that holds all the tasks.

After that you can specify the file location of your personal tasks.

The application has 2 modes:

A - for the admin, where he can add/update/delete/see tasks

B - for the user that can browse the list of tasks and can save the tasks he wishes to do. He can also see his tasks, or filter them.

You can chose what mode to use after specifying the file locations.
