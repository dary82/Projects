Hangman game made in Python.

The menu has 2 options:
  
  1 - Add a sentence to the game
  
  2 - Play the game
  
The game is played in the classic way, and the format is: [word to guess] - hangman

Each time you guess wrong, the next letter from the word hangman appears, and if the word hangman is completed before you guess the word, you lose.

Example:
h _ _ _ o -    (this is the initial state of the game with the word to guess being hello)

h _ _ _ o - h  (this is the state of the game with no guessed letters and 1 misake).
